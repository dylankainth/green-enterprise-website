            <p>High performing teams are usually diverse teams with different skills and backgrounds. It is easy to forget that others don’t think like us so this is a great opportunity to find out more about yourself and about your teammates. High performing teams also know each other’s strengths and weaknesses well which helps in delegate tasks.</p>

            <p>On the <a href="https://thechangehub.com.au/change-resources">Change Hub</a>, there are three quizzes on Communication/Learning/Teamworking. Complete the one on teamworking and share the results with your teammates. Think about how your strengths might be best used going forward. You will be hearing from the CEO of Change Hub, Dr Lydia Moussa in future content updates.</p>
            <p>Use this as an opportunity to start your pitch deck with a short profile and perhaps a picture of each team member. Don’t worry too much about the formatting right now, you can tidy it up later but your pitch deck at the end can take any form. A ppt/word doc/Canva/Prezi or anything else creative. It will support your one minute video with further detail. Although not mandatory, using the content updates will be an easy and natural way to build up your pitch deck.</p>

      <p class="fs-4">It is really easy to dive in and start thinking about solutions but it is also important to step back and think about why you are doing this.</p>
      <p>Often entrepreneurs are trying to solve a problem, other times they might see themselves as solving a problem that consumers didn’t even know they had!</p>
      <p>For social entrepreneurs like yourselves, you might want to think about the 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) as a place to start and frame your thinking. Your group may be more interested in focusing on one or more of them and this might be something you want to highlight in your pitch deck, although not necessarily. </p> 
      <img src="/undevelopmentgoals.png" class="img-fluid px-5" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>It is definitely worth thinking about your vision, goals, objectives and measures although you will likely need to come back to this later and similarly with a stakeholder map.</p>

      <p class="fs-5">You may wish to watch the videos above from people that have worked for Amazon, Asahi and Tesco as well as all being entrepreneurs and business owners</p>
      <p> 
      Although I am sure you have already started thinking of ideas for your good or service and you may have narrowed it down to your main idea already. If you haven’t then perhaps use the framework of the <b>SDGs</b> or through the lens of the theme: <b>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</b> (not all of these need to be addressed).It would be really nice to see some of your thinking and how you came up with your idea in your pitch deck.
      </p> 
      <p> 
      Try to balance viability and creativity and as you develop your idea you should:
      </p> 
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>- Consider the judgement criteria</li>
        <li>- Perform some <b>market research</b>
            <ul>
                <li>- Quantitative – numbers based</li>
                <li>- Qualitative – opinion based</li>
                <li>- Primary – performed by you – e.g. survey friends or family</li>
                <li>- Secondary – performed by others e.g. information online</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>- Consider the customer first and foremost<li>
        <li>- Then consider the competition</li>
        <li>- You should also think about your <b>USP (Unique Selling Point)</b> what will make you stand out in the market</li>
        <li>- Consider doing a <b>market map</b> (see an example for chocolate below) and/or a <b>SWOT analysis</b> (you can use the template below if you wish)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can include your research in your pitch deck. Don’t be afraid to go back to the drawing board if your market research doesn’t go the way you had hoped. You may need to adapt, iterate or completely change your idea.</p>

    <p class="fs-5">By now, you should have finalised your idea with a strong USP and perhaps done some market, although there is still time to tweak it later.</p>
    <p>You should now start thinking about the details of the design. The Circular Economy is considered one important part of the future and relies on products and services being designed in such a way that considers the full product lifecycle from getting the materials and resources to the end of life as you can see in the graphic below. Nespresso coffee pods could be a good example. The pods can be returned with the coffee used as biogas or fertiliser and the aluminium can be used for new pods. </p>
  
    <p>For your pitch deck:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>- If you are in the top age category then you may wish to contact different suppliers to find out about their sustainability credentials and garner quotes.</li>
      <li>- Clearly show what would happen to your product/service at the end of life.</li>
      <li>-	Begin to consider the impact of incorporating sustainability in terms of cost and see if you can use creative ways of reducing cost in the long term.</li>

    <h3 class="overflow-hidden">Costs</h3>
  <p>You need to make some estimate of how much it would cost to produce your product (consider raw materials, labour, shipping).</p>
  <p>In the early stages of a business production tends to cost more, but as a business grows, these costs can be reduced for a variety of reasons, mainly due to bulk-buying or economies of scale. If I ask a factory to make 100 ties that will cost me a lot more (per tie) than if I order 10,000 ties (made of recycled plastic, of course).</p>
  <p>For some of you, costs will be easy to ascertain and you can even contact suppliers to get quotes, for other groups it will be more of an estimate.</p>

  <h3 class="overflow-hidden">Pricing Strategies</h3>
  <p>Some of you may be providing a good or service for free but most of you will want to sell to your target market. You need to decide how much to sell for. A good way of doing this is to do some primary and/or secondary market research. Primary research would involve talking to consumers and telling them about your product and then asking a) if they would buy it and b) how much for. Secondary research would likely involve checking the price of similar products on the internet or in shops.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>1. Competitive pricing – price the product in and around supplier, slightly below to undercut them or slightly above if you think yours is better in some way.</p></li>
    <li><p>2. Cost + pricing – looking at the cost per unit you estimated and adding a percentage to that.</p></li>
    <li><p>3. Price skimming – you have something really new/unique and exciting – this may lead you to charge an initially high price for early adopters which you may drop later</p></li>
    <li><p>4. Penetration pricing – coming in with an initially very low price or offers in order to hook consumers with the plan to raise them later (think Netflix).</p></li>
    <li><p>5. Psychological pricing - £99 or £1.99 instead of £2. This can be paired with any of the above. Companies still do this because they think it works. </p></li>
    <li><p>6. Premium pricing – often gives the appearance (and hopefully the reality) that the product is of high quality like Lindt chocolate </p></li>
    <li><p>7. Freemium – a service might start with a free version with the hope of impressing consumers with the quality and encouraging them to pay for a version with expanded range of features (e.g. chess.com or Spotify premium) </p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Pitch Deck: It is a great idea to include a summary of your costs, market research for pricing and explanation of your pricing strategy. Try to make this as visual as possible. More information about the contents to the pitch deck will be attached soon.</p>

  <h3 class="overflow-hidden">Extension for the top age category</h3>
  <p><b>Revenue</b> = Price x quantity sold</p>
  <p>A sales forecast attempts to predict how much will be sold.</p>
  <p>For established companies this will largely be based on historical sales and a large number of other factors including time of year, weather, marketing campaigns.</p>
  <p>New companies must guesstimate best on research and competitors as well as measuring the size of the market.</p>

  <p><b>Profit</b> = Revenue – costs</p>
  <p>A profit forecast can be made by taking the cost per unit away from the price and multiplying by the expected number of sales. In the below example, the selling price of the can (aluminium and recyclable) of water for countries where there is no running water is £1.10. Designed to reduce plastic waste with a huge potential target market. The costs are £0.29 for liquid and canning. £0.27 for storage and distribution and £0.05 for marketing with what looks like a very high and quite optimistic profit margin of £0.49 per can. If the company sell 1000 cans in their first year, they will make £4900 (not including their time and effort in the costs).</p>

  <p>When thinking about branding and marketing it all comes back to the <b>target market</b>. It is also worth thinking about the <b>marketing mix</b> (Product, Price, Promotion and Place).</p>
  <p>You may wish to discuss with your group which you think is the most important.</p>
  <p>You will have already spent a lot of time thinking about your product and its <b>USP</b> and likewise the pricing strategy.</p>
  <p><b>Place</b> concerns where you will sell it. Will this be directly to the customer <b>B2C (Business to consumer)</b> or <b>B2B (Business to Business)</b> or via a retailer (ie a farmer will see eggs through a supermarket or a business may sell phone cases on Amazon).</p>
  <p><b>Place</b> could be a physical store or online. If it is a physical store where would that be? A coffee shop in a train station will attract a lot of customers. If it is through your own website how will you get traffic to go there? Or if it is on Amazon/Ali Baba or similar how would you make sure you are towards the top of the search so customers find you.</p>
  <p><b>Promotion</b> links in here. Would you use <b>traditional</b> methods of <b>advertising</b> like TV/billboard/magazine/newspaper adds or would you consider social media marketing which might be cheaper and more targeted.</p>

<p><b>Pitch deck</b>: Perhaps you could design a logo and make an advert with a tagline or design a social media post for your pitch deck and identify where you would post it and why.</p>

<p>Branding isn’t just a logo which is a good symbol of the brand but brand is bigger than that – it is what people think of when they think of your business.</p>
