            <p>High performing teams are usually diverse teams with different skills and backgrounds. It is easy to forget that others don’t think like us so this is a great opportunity to find out more about yourself and about your teammates. High performing teams also know each other’s strengths and weaknesses well which helps in delegate tasks.</p>

            <p>On the <a href="https://thechangehub.com.au/change-resources">Change Hub</a>, there are three quizzes on Communication/Learning/Teamworking. Complete the one on teamworking and share the results with your teammates. Think about how your strengths might be best used going forward. You will be hearing from the CEO of Change Hub, Dr Lydia Moussa in future content updates.</p>
            <p>Use this as an opportunity to start your pitch deck with a short profile and perhaps a picture of each team member. Don’t worry too much about the formatting right now, you can tidy it up later but your pitch deck at the end can take any form. A ppt/word doc/Canva/Prezi or anything else creative. It will support your one minute video with further detail. Although not mandatory, using the content updates will be an easy and natural way to build up your pitch deck.</p>

      <p class="fs-4">It is really easy to dive in and start thinking about solutions but it is also important to step back and think about why you are doing this.</p>
      <p>Often entrepreneurs are trying to solve a problem, other times they might see themselves as solving a problem that consumers didn’t even know they had!</p>
      <p>For social entrepreneurs like yourselves, you might want to think about the 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) as a place to start and frame your thinking. Your group may be more interested in focusing on one or more of them and this might be something you want to highlight in your pitch deck, although not necessarily. </p> 
      <img src="/undevelopmentgoals.png" class="img-fluid px-5" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>It is definitely worth thinking about your vision, goals, objectives and measures although you will likely need to come back to this later and similarly with a stakeholder map.</p>
