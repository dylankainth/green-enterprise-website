            <p>High performing teams are usually diverse teams with different skills and backgrounds. It is easy to forget that others don’t think like us so this is a great opportunity to find out more about yourself and about your teammates. High performing teams also know each other’s strengths and weaknesses well which helps in delegate tasks.</p>

            <p>On the <a href="https://thechangehub.com.au/change-resources">Change Hub</a>, there are three quizzes on Communication/Learning/Teamworking. Complete the one on teamworking and share the results with your teammates. Think about how your strengths might be best used going forward. You will be hearing from the CEO of Change Hub, Dr Lydia Moussa in future content updates.</p>
            <p>Use this as an opportunity to start your pitch deck with a short profile and perhaps a picture of each team member. Don’t worry too much about the formatting right now, you can tidy it up later but your pitch deck at the end can take any form. A ppt/word doc/Canva/Prezi or anything else creative. It will support your one minute video with further detail. Although not mandatory, using the content updates will be an easy and natural way to build up your pitch deck.</p>

      <p class="fs-4">It is really easy to dive in and start thinking about solutions but it is also important to step back and think about why you are doing this.</p>
      <p>Often entrepreneurs are trying to solve a problem, other times they might see themselves as solving a problem that consumers didn’t even know they had!</p>
      <p>For social entrepreneurs like yourselves, you might want to think about the 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) as a place to start and frame your thinking. Your group may be more interested in focusing on one or more of them and this might be something you want to highlight in your pitch deck, although not necessarily. </p> 
      <img src="/undevelopmentgoals.png" class="img-fluid px-5" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>It is definitely worth thinking about your vision, goals, objectives and measures although you will likely need to come back to this later and similarly with a stakeholder map.</p>

      <p class="fs-5">You may wish to watch the videos above from people that have worked for Amazon, Asahi and Tesco as well as all being entrepreneurs and business owners</p>
      <p> 
      Although I am sure you have already started thinking of ideas for your good or service and you may have narrowed it down to your main idea already. If you haven’t then perhaps use the framework of the <b>SDGs</b> or through the lens of the theme: <b>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</b> (not all of these need to be addressed).It would be really nice to see some of your thinking and how you came up with your idea in your pitch deck.
      </p> 
      <p> 
      Try to balance viability and creativity and as you develop your idea you should:
      </p> 
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>- Consider the judgement criteria</li>
        <li>- Perform some <b>market research</b>
            <ul>
                <li>- Quantitative – numbers based</li>
                <li>- Qualitative – opinion based</li>
                <li>- Primary – performed by you – e.g. survey friends or family</li>
                <li>- Secondary – performed by others e.g. information online</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>- Consider the customer first and foremost<li>
        <li>- Then consider the competition</li>
        <li>- You should also think about your <b>USP (Unique Selling Point)</b> what will make you stand out in the market</li>
        <li>- Consider doing a <b>market map</b> (see an example for chocolate below) and/or a <b>SWOT analysis</b> (you can use the template below if you wish)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can include your research in your pitch deck. Don’t be afraid to go back to the drawing board if your market research doesn’t go the way you had hoped. You may need to adapt, iterate or completely change your idea.</p>
