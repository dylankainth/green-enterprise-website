            <p>High performing teams are usually diverse teams with different skills and backgrounds. It is easy to forget that others don’t think like us so this is a great opportunity to find out more about yourself and about your teammates.

            <p>On the <a href="https://thechangehub.com.au/change-resources">Change Hub</a>, there are three quizzes on Communication/Learning/Teamworking. Complete the one on teamworking and share the results with your teammates. Think about how your strengths might be best used going forward. You will be hearing from the CEO of Change Hub, Dr Lydia Moussa in future content updates.</p>
            <p>Use this as an opportunity to start your pitch deck with a short profile and perhaps a picture of each team member. Don’t worry too much about the formatting right now, you can tidy it up later but your pitch deck at the end can take any form. A ppt/word doc/Canva/Prezi or anything else creative. It will support your one minute video with further detail. Although not mandatory, using the content updates will be an easy and natural way to build up your pitch deck.</p>
